She goes on with her head down so as to fight the sense that she is going to fall up off the world and burn like an inverse meteor.<br/><br/>\nThe message that brought her to this place had no sign but she could hear Cayde in it.

Her jaw aches. She used to imagine biting out his throat with armored teeth.<br/><br/>\nThe stone smokes around her where the arc fire lashes it and the shrapnel guns throw up leaves of obsidian like glass butterflies. She shoots her bandoliers dry and a team of Vandals in glassy stealth leap up to rush her with knives but she raises her hand and burns them down with the golden gun, laughing, crying out Draksis, Draksis, I am come!<br/><br/>\nShe kills them all and takes the next ridge, high above the Cinders. She can see the blue-green pools and the cave mouths where the Vex lights dance. And there among them, gowned in smoke and ash, is the long shark shape of a Ketch, a Wintership, the Kell&#39;s ship, come down to nest.<br/><br/>\nShe could go down there now and finish this.

That&#39;s true enough. Out in the field I never had a second thought.<br/><br/>\nMy old friend Andal—he used to stand here, right in this spot—he&#39;d come up with these wild stories. He&#39;d say, you know, Cayde, I&#39;ve been examining the evidence, and personally I&#39;ve come to think it&#39;s you. You&#39;re Rasputin, legendary Warmind, defender of Earth. And I wish you&#39;d remember that, so you could reclaim your full power and save us all.<br/><br/>\nYou can see how that&#39;d be embarrassing, especially when he&#39;d say it right in front of Zavala, who already thought I was wasting my life scrounging for engrams. You know how Zavala gets. But I&#39;d just say, well, Andal, you might be on to something there, but if I&#39;m honest with you I think coordinating our defense throughout the solar system sounds exhausting, so I&#39;d best leave it to you.<br/><br/>\nThen Andal goes and plays his final joke, and I end up as the punchline. So here I stand, reading reports, giving orders, and getting my worry on.<br/><br/>\nOne day I ask Ikora, hey, of course I know all about Rasputin, but really, what are we looking for? When Rahool asks for crashed warsats, when we send Holborn to Mars to look for computers, when Zavala gets all gruff about the Fallen in the Cosmodrome—what are we really after? If I left my post and got my ship and just went out there tomorrow, real heroic, and I found Rasputin, what would happen?<br/><br/>\nWould we all be saved?<br/><br/>\nGood question, she says—hang on, let me do my Ikora voice. As you know, Cayde, Rasputin pretty much ran the Golden Age, especially all the secret military business. Rasputin had antimatter-powered death rays and a hundred thousand satellites and nearly as much brainpower as me. Rasputin fought the Collapse. It knows things we need.<br/><br/>\nRight, I said, but Rasputin lost. The Traveler saved us.<br/><br/>\nBut the Traveler&#39;s silent now, Ikora said, and Rasputin lives. Right now Rasputin is out there, reaching out, rebuilding, growing.<br/><br/>\nSo I say what I want to say every day, it&#39;s no secret, I say—well, I&#39;ll go find it, then. I&#39;ll go tell Rasputin we need its help.<br/><br/>\nAnd Ikora looks at me with one of those looks that—you know sometimes you talk to Ikora and you just think, wow, you are not even using a fraction of your brain on me, are you? One of those looks. She says: Cayde, the problem isn&#39;t just that we can&#39;t find Rasputin. The problem is that it&#39;s not clear to any of us Rasputin wants to be found.<br/><br/>\nThat&#39;s the way things seem to turn out, up here in the Tower. Nothing simple to do. No easy answers.<br/><br/>\nAnd all I can think is, if Rasputin had all those mighty tools, and it lost—what did it learn? What&#39;s it going to try this time around? When I hear about the Dust Palace, those Psion Flayers getting into Rasputin&#39;s mind, I wonder... what would they talk about, Rasputin and those creatures?<br/><br/>\n&#39;I was a servant too.

That value, in turn, makes Glimmer a useful means of exchange - especially with those who venture beyond the City&#39;s walls.<br/><br/>\nGlimmer passes through an economic life cycle. New Glimmer comes from reclaimed Golden Age caches and technology - whether a tiny mechanism or an underground lode seeded by ancient machines. This expansion of the Glimmer supply drives down the value of Glimmer. But Glimmer is also constantly used by the City&#39;s industry, which converts it into necessary components and materials. This sink helps keep Glimmer scarce, and therefore valuable.<br/><br/>\nBetween this inflow and outflow lies the pool of liquidity - Glimmer used as trade currency. Master Rahool in the Tower, for example, sells recovered matter engrams in exchange for Glimmer, since he knows he can use Glimmer to acquire new engrams and keep them flowing to Guardians. <br/><br/>\nNewborn Guardians often complain that they should be issued high-quality gear for free - are they not, after all, fighting for the future of the City? Unfortunately, this gear requires resources to manufacture. Guardians must bring in enough Glimmer and other staples, like spinmetal and relic iron, to keep the engine of the City&#39;s economy turning.

We didn&#39;t, you know, do anything actively - no handshake, no icy stare of grudging mutual respect. I don&#39;t even know which hand you would shake. Do they shake hands? It must be complicated.<br/><br/>\nAnyway, it was like this. I was on the Moon. I cracked a Hive structure near Mare Imbrium, looking for a Shrine, and they just - swarmed. Ranks and ranks and ranks of Thrall, pouring out between the columns, but the columns were Knights, and all the shadows behind them rose up hissing sorcery.<br/><br/>\nOf course I ran. <br/><br/>\nI had a line of egress and while yes it was full of Thrall I had a backup too. I went upslope. Took cover in the shadow of a crashed Phaeton. Emptied my machine gun, ducked down to reload, and saw her at the other end of the hull, killing Thrall: a Fallen in Exile colors, bannered in the marks of a Baron, though the flags were claw-torn and stained with Hive ash. She was alone. I think she must have lost her crew.<br/><br/>\nI didn&#39;t really have time to shoot her and she didn&#39;t really have time to shoot me so we just went back to killing Hive. Knights pushed me out into the open and back up the range to a high stone saddle in the shadow of an old interferometry array. It was good ground so she came up there too.<br/><br/>\nFor a while we just killed things which is hard to make interesting in a story so I&#39;ll pass it over.<br/><br/>\nAt the end the Wizards came. I climbed the array to get an angle on them and she fell back to the base of the antennae where she broke her swords off in a Knight. I saw that happen and I don&#39;t know if I can tell you how I felt. She was another living thing with a mind I could understand and she hadn&#39;t howled at me or tried to eat my Ghost. I cheered when the Knight went down.<br/><br/>\nWhen I came down, empty on all guns, she was slumped against a bulkhead staring at me with all her tiny black eyes. Ether leaking out of her like smoke. The Knight hadn&#39;t died easily. Downslope the last Wizard moved like fire behind another line of Thrall.<br/><br/>\nI looked at her and wondered how many innocent human lives she&#39;d ended on those broken blades.<br/><br/>\nShe did the strangest thing then. Took the last shock pistol from her bandolier and threw it between us, as if to offer it. When I went to pick it up she tried to knife me, but she was slow, and when I broke her arms and opened her throat she didn&#39;t seem surprised.<br/><br/>\nTo this day I wonder if she hated me, or wanted to make me kill her, or just felt she should spare me the choice.<br/><br/>\nI did kill a few Thrall with that pistol.","unlockHowToText":"Unlock this card by playing Destiny.","cardLabel":"H1","rarity":1,"unlockFlagHash":0,"points":5,"normalResolution":{"image":{"rect":{"x":969,"y":838,"height":419,"width":323},"sheetPath":"/common/destiny_content/grimoire/images/Fallen-csprites_16b6ef6b52856dded355a658941f5589.jpg","sheetSize":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":1676,"width":1292}},"smallImage":{"rect":{"x":913,"y":0,"height":83,"width":83},"sheetPath":"/common/destiny_content/grimoire/images/Fallen-csprites-sm_b79447071693f1612e6354858e912427.jpg","sheetSize":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":83,"width":1079}}},"highResolution":{"image":{"rect":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":728,"width":560},"sheetPath":"/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/207020_6589e3ec7ef490e51a161a3f9c667708.jpg","sheetSize":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":728,"width":560}},"smallImage":{"rect":{"x":1595,"y":0,"height":145,"width":145},"sheetPath":"/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/Fallen-csprites-sm_673c57360446836b41dc497a5747dc36.jpg","sheetSize":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":145,"width":1885}}}},"207030":{"cardId":207030,"cardName":"Ghost Fragment: Fallen 2","cardIntro":"<b>A ROUTINE SUMMATION OF DARLINGS WON AND HEROICALLY HELD DURING THIS PROFITABLE CYCLE, AS COMPILED BY A DREG</b>","cardDescription":"ammunition of rich makes, quantity adequate to incinerate 6X6 foe<br/><br/>\n11 operational weapons, alien design, suitable for salvage<br/><br/>\n3 explosive charges of obvious design, suitable for salvage<br/><br/>\n1 cabal fusion reactor, disabled but perhaps repairable<br/><br/>\n61 machines, alien, inoperable, unknown significances<br/><br/>\n13 alien machines, inoperable, known significances<br/><br/>\n3 glints<br/><br/>\n7 herealways<br/><br/>\n1103 twists of essence<br/><br/>\n15 human body parts, kept for study, scorn<br/><br/>\n55 human adornments, full of glory and warm memory, worth the cost of their acquisition and more so<br/><br/>\nsome ether, quantity negligible<br/><br/>\nconsiderable experience in battle<br/><br/>\n4 dregs dead, rendering House of Winter weaker<br/><br/>\n1 dreg honoring self and House, leading to consideration of fabricated arms<br/><br/>\n1 disabled Fallen skiff, scrubbed of House identity and stories<br/><br/>\n1 Fallen story found beside the disabled skiff, unknown House, partly corrupted, rendered as follows:<br/><br/>\nwhat others call dark which is not I know what it is but no time room calm given for an appropriate telling so I say only that what is not shadow is an ally and a wonder and I respect what I cannot steal from and you cannot take from the dark you can claim only pain from the dark and that is why the dark is worthy of love beyond all other love that astonishing ability to evade being robbed<br/><br/>\nI love what I will not name<br/><br/>\n1 story, Fallen and found beneath the skiff, unknown House, story uncorrupted <br/><br/>\nsubsequently the second recording has been washed away<br/><br/>\noperator error<br/><br/>\nI know what no one else knows and now I am a marvel with ten thousand arms","unlockHowToText":"Unlock this card by playing Destiny.","cardLabel":"H1","rarity":1,"unlockFlagHash":0,"points":5,"normalResolution":{"image":{"rect":{"x":0,"y":1257,"height":419,"width":323},"sheetPath":"/common/destiny_content/grimoire/images/Fallen-csprites_16b6ef6b52856dded355a658941f5589.jpg","sheetSize":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":1676,"width":1292}},"smallImage":{"rect":{"x":996,"y":0,"height":83,"width":83},"sheetPath":"/common/destiny_content/grimoire/images/Fallen-csprites-sm_b79447071693f1612e6354858e912427.jpg","sheetSize":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":83,"width":1079}}},"highResolution":{"image":{"rect":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":728,"width":560},"sheetPath":"/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/207030_6589e3ec7ef490e51a161a3f9c667708.jpg","sheetSize":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":728,"width":560}},"smallImage":{"rect":{"x":1740,"y":0,"height":145,"width":145},"sheetPath":"/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/Fallen-csprites-sm_673c57360446836b41dc497a5747dc36.jpg","sheetSize":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":145,"width":1885}}}},"207050":{"cardId":207050,"cardName":"House of Wolves","cardIntro":"<b>&quot;These ones are mine.&quot;</b>","cardIntroAttribution":"<i>- The Queen</i>","cardDescription":"The bulk of the House of Wolves now falls under the control of the Queen of the Reef.

Killed our Golden Age. Nearly wiped us out. Only the Traveler saved us, and at a shattering cost.<br/><br/>\nThe Speaker tells of a cosmic force that swept over us and caused the Collapse. Legend calls it the Darkness, the Traveler&#39;s ancient enemy, which hunted it across space.<br/><br/>\nAll we have left are questions. Centuries of debate gave birth to competing arguments on the nature of the Darkness and the Collapse.<br/><br/>\nThe Pujari Position describes the Darkness as a force with both physical and moral presence, an actualization of evil. Pujari art depicts the Darkness as a great storm, or as a change in conduct, a corruption that emerged from within and poisoned the Golden Age.<br/><br/>\nSaint-14&#39;s Position argues that the Darkness was an invading armada, an alien force of incredible - but tangible - power. Some adherents believe that this armada sprang from species rejected or discarded by the Traveler for their sins.<br/><br/>\nUlan-Tan&#39;s Thesis considers the Darkness a necessary symmetry to the Traveler in a cosmic balance. In this view, the Traveler&#39;s goodness led it to sacrifice for others, and it is up to us to return this goodness by healing the Traveler.<br/><br/>\nThe Monist Position, or the Deflationary Position, considers the Darkness as a technologically sophisticated force, perhaps a post-Singularity intelligence. Adherents invoke information theory or contend that the universe is a simulation, allowing advanced intelligence to gain weakly acausal powers by bending the rules.<br/><br/>\nThe Acataleptic Clause claims that we are intrinsically unable to understand the Darkness. In many respects this belief parallels the Praxic Creed, which suggests that we should stop worrying about the nature of the Darkness and focus on resisting and defeating it.<br/><br/>\nCertain positions - often labeled heretical - imply that the Traveler itself triggered the Collapse, or that it knew the Darkness was coming for it and hoped to use the Solar System as a sacrifice or a proxy army. The Binary Star cult is one notable example.","unlockHowToText":"Unlock this card by playing Destiny.","rarity":1,"unlockFlagHash":0,"points":5,"normalResolution":{"image":{"rect":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":419,"width":323},"sheetPath":"/common/destiny_content/grimoire/images/Darkness-csprites_63801f6f5f6c16c48039e9fd7f084aa8.jpg","sheetSize":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":419,"width":1615}},"smallImage":{"rect":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":83,"width":83},"sheetPath":"/common/destiny_content/grimoire/images/Darkness-csprites-sm_2e0ebbfc52d888be015a3e01086c625f.jpg","sheetSize":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":83,"width":415}}},"highResolution":{"image":{"rect":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":728,"width":560},"sheetPath":"/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/209010_09155e37afdebdef65137bf54e1e4d55.jpg","sheetSize":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":728,"width":560}},"smallImage":{"rect":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":145,"width":145},"sheetPath":"/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/Darkness-csprites-sm_e21d88c219d0bdff9ca168de9da384b7.jpg","sheetSize":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":145,"width":725}}}},"209020":{"cardId":209020,"cardName":"Ghost Fragment: Darkness","cardDescription":"V113NNI070XMX001 SECRET HADAL INSTANT<br/>\nAI-COM/RSPN: SOLSECCENT//SxISR//DEEPSPACE<br/>\nCONTACT CONTACT CONTACT<br/>\nTRANSIENT.

It explains - this is not hyperbole, this is the farthest thing from exaggeration - EVERYTHING. <br/><br/>\nBut you lay it out and they stare at you like you&#39;ve just been exhaling dust. Maybe they&#39;re missing some underlying scaffold of truth. Maybe they are all propped on a bed of lies that must be burned away.<br/><br/>\nWhy does anything exist?<br/><br/>\nNo no no no no don&#39;t reach for that word. There&#39;s no &#39;reason&#39;. That&#39;s teleology and teleology will stitch your eyelids shut.<br/><br/>\nWhy do we have atoms? Because atomic matter is more stable than the primordial broth. Atoms defeated the broth. That was the first war. There were two ways to be and one of them won. And everything that came next was made of atoms.<br/><br/>\nAtoms made stars. Stars made galaxies. Worlds simmered down to rock and acid and in those smoking primal seas the first living molecule learned to copy itself. All of this happened by the one law, the blind law, which exists without mind or meaning. It&#39;s the simplest law but it has no worshippers here (out there, though, out there - !)<br/><br/>\nHOW DO I EXPLAIN IT it&#39;s so simple WHY DON&#39;T YOU SEE <br/><br/>\nImagine three great nations under three great queens. The first queen writes a great book of law and her rule is just. The second queen builds a high tower and her people climb it to see the stars. The third queen raises an army and conquers everything.<br/><br/>\nThe future belongs to one of these queens. Her rule is harshest and her people are unhappy. But she rules.<br/><br/>\nThis explains everything, understand? This is why the universe is the way it is, and not some other way. Existence is a game that everything plays, and some strategies are winners: the ability to exist, to shape existence, to remake it so that your descendants - molecules or stars or people or ideas - will flourish, and others will find no ground to grow.<br/><br/>\nAnd as the universe ticks on towards the close, the great players will face each other. In the next round there will be three queens and all of them will have armies, and now it will be a battle of swords - until one discovers the cannon, or the plague, or the killing word.<br/><br/>\nEverything is becoming more ruthless and in the end only the most ruthless will remain (LOOK UP AT THE SKY) and they will hunt the territories of the night and extinguish the first glint of competition before it can even understand what it faces or why it has transgressed. This is the shape of victory: to rule the universe so absolutely that nothing will ever exist except by your consent. This is the queen at the end of time, whose sovereignty is eternal because no other sovereign can defeat it. And there is no reason for it, no more than there was reason for the victory of the atom. It is simply the winning play.<br/><br/>\nOf course, it might be that there was another country, with other queens, and in this country they sat down together and made one law and one tower and one army to guard their borders. This is the dream of small minds: a gentle place ringed in spears.<br/><br/>\nBut I do not think those spears will hold against the queen of the country of armies.

The facts won&#39;t sync with the reality, but they&#39;ll be close, and there&#39;s no one to say otherwise, so for all intents and purposes, this will be the history of a settlement we called Palamon and the horrors that followed an all too brief peace.<br/><br/>\nI remember home, and stories of a paradise we&#39;d all get to see some day - of a City, &quot;shining even in the night.&quot; Palamon didn&#39;t shine, but it was sanctuary, of a sort. <br/><br/>\nWe&#39;d settled in the heart of a range that stretched the horizon. Wooded mountains that shot with purpose toward the sky. Winters were harsh, but the trees and peaks hid us from the world. We talked about moving on, sometimes, striking out for the City. But it was just a longing.<br/><br/>\nDrifters came and went. On occasion they would stay, but rarely. <br/>\nWe had no real government, but there was rule of law. Basic tenets agreed upon by all and eventually overseen by Magistrate Loken.<br/><br/>\nAnd there you have it...no government, until there was. I was young, so I barely understood. I remember Loken as a hardworking man who just became broken. Mostly I think he was sad. Sad and frightened. As his fingers tightened on Palamon, people left. Those who stayed saw our days became grey. Loken&#39;s protection - from the Fallen, from ourselves - became dictatorial. <br/><br/>\nLooking back, I think maybe Loken had just lost too much - of himself, his family. But everyone lost something. And some of us had nothing to begin with. My only memory of my parents is a haze, like a daydream, and a small light, like the spark of their souls. It&#39;s not anything I dwell on. They left me early, taken by Dregs.<br/><br/>\nPalamon raised me from there. The family I call my own - called my own - cared for me as if I was their natural born son. And life was good. Being the only life I knew, my judgment is skewed, and it wasn&#39;t easy - pocked by loss as it was - but I would call it good.<br/><br/>\nUntil, of course, it wasn&#39;t.<br/><br/>\nUntil two men entered my world.

Maybe none of us had. He&#39;d said he was only passing through, and I believed him - still do, but life can get in the way of intent, and often does.<br/><br/>\nI can picture that day with near perfect clarity. Of all the details though - every nuance, every moment - the memory that sticks in my mind is the iron on Jaren&#39;s hip. A cannon that looked both pristine and lived in. Like a relic of every battle he&#39;d ever fought, hung low at his waist - a trophy and a warning.<br/><br/>\nThis man was dangerous, but there was a light about him - a pureness to his weight - that seemed to hint that his ire was something earned, not carelessly given.<br/><br/>\nI&#39;d been the first to see him as he approached, but soon most of Palamon had turned out to greet him. My father held me back as everyone stood in silence.<br/><br/>\nJaren didn&#39;t make a sound behind his sleek racer&#39;s helmet. He looked just like the heroes in the stories, and to this day I&#39;m not sure one way or the other if the silence between the town&#39;s people and the adventurer was born of fear or respect. I like to think the latter, but any truth I try to place on the moment would be of my own making.<br/><br/>\nAs we waited for Magistrate Loken to arrive and make an official greeting, my patience got the best of me. I shook free of my father&#39;s heavy hand and made the short sprint across the court, stopping a few paces from where this new curiosity stood - a man unlike any other.<br/><br/>\nI stared up at him and he lowered his attention to me, his eyes hidden behind the thick tinted visor of his headgear. My sight quickly fell to his sidearm. I was transfixed by it. I imagined all the places that weapon had been. All of the wonders it had seen. The horrors it had endured. My imagination darted from one heroic act to the next.<br/><br/>\nI barely registered when he began to kneel, holding out the iron as if an offering. But my eyes locked onto the piece, mesmerized. <br/><br/>\nI recall turning back to my father and seeing the looks on the faces of everyone I knew. There was worry there - my father slowly shaking his head as if pleading with me to ignore the gift. <br/><br/>\nI turned back to the man I would come to know as Jaren Ward, the finest Hunter this system may ever know and one of the greatest Guardians to ever defend the Traveler&#39;s Light...<br/><br/>\nAnd I took the weapon in my hand. Carefully. Gently.<br/><br/>\nNot to use. But to observe. To imagine.

But, looking back, I think we were all just grasping for any good reason to turn back.<br/><br/>\nNot because we would—turn back—but because it seemed to be our only real hope, and I think we all knew it.<br/><br/>\nForward. Where we were headed—into the unknown. And following the footsteps we were. It all just started to feel like a never-ending dead end after a while.<br/><br/>\nJaren never wavered though. Not once.<br/><br/>\nAt least not to any noticeable degree.<br/><br/>\nIt was his drive, his conviction, that kept us going.<br/><br/>\nAnd—it&#39;s hard to think on—but if I&#39;m honest, it was his death that rekindled my own fire. A fire that was all but exhausted on that cold night.<br/><br/>\nHe seemed confident we were close.<br/><br/>\nBut more than confident—sure. He seemed sure.<br/><br/>\nNo one else felt it—our own confidence, and any enthusiasm we&#39;d had was set to wither soon as Brevin, Trenn and Mel were gunned down.<br/><br/>\nThe Ghost—Jaren&#39;s Ghost—never said a word to any of us. Just hung there. Always alert. Always judging. Not us, per se, but the moment. Any moment.<br/><br/>\nI never got the sense it thought of us as lesser. More that it was guarded, wary.<br/><br/>\nWe knew it could speak. We&#39;d overheard them a few times. Just brief words, and no one ever pressed the subject.<br/><br/>\nFrom time to time I caught its gaze lingering on me, but always assumed the attention was a result of the bond Jaren and I had. He was a father to me. At the time I didn&#39;t know why he&#39;d singled me out as someone to care for. Someone to protect. After all the loss, I welcomed it, but looking back—taking in the arm&#39;s length at which he kept the others—I guess I should&#39;ve known, or at least suspected there was more to it.<br/><br/>\nWe all woke that night, closer to morning than the previous day.<br/><br/>\nA crack of gunfire split through the wood. Then more.<br/><br/>\nFar off, but near enough to pump the blood.<br/><br/>\nA familiar ring. &quot;Last Word.&quot; Jaren&#39;s sidearm. His best friend.<br/>\nThen another. A single shot, an unmistakable echo calling through the night. Hushed, cutting.<br/><br/>\nOne shot, dark and infernal. Followed by silence.<br/><br/>\nWe crouched low and quiet. Listening. Hoping.<br/><br/>\nJaren was gone. Off on his own.<br/><br/>\nMaybe we were closer than we&#39;d allowed ourselves to believe.<br/><br/>\nToo close.<br/><br/>\nHe&#39;d gone to face death alone.<br/><br/>\nI couldn&#39;t admit it—not at the time—but he thought he was <br/>\nprotecting us.<br/><br/>\nAfter such a long road—years on its heels, a trail littered with suffering and fire—maybe he just couldn&#39;t take the thought of anymore dead &quot;kids,&quot; as he called us.<br/><br/>\nThe echoes faded and we all held still. No way to track the direction. No sense in rushing blind.<br/><br/>\nWhat was done was done.<br/><br/>\nThe cadence of the shots fired told a story none of us cared to hear.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Last Word&quot; it hadn&#39;t been. And somewhere in the world, close enough for us to bear absent witness but far enough to be a dream, Jaren Ward lay dead or dying. And there was nothing to be done.<br/><br/>\nHours passed. An eternity.<br/><br/>\nWe held our spot, but as the sun rose the others began to fade back into the world. Without Jaren there was nothing holding us together. No driving force. Vengeance had grown stale as a motivator. Fear and a longing to see more suns rise drove a wedge between duty and desire.<br/><br/>\nBy midday I was alone. I couldn&#39;t leave. Wouldn&#39;t.<br/><br/>\nEither I would find Jaren and set him at ease, or the other would find me and that would be a fitting end.<br/><br/>\nDeath marching on.<br/><br/>\nBut then, a motion. Quick and darting. My muscles tensed and my hand shot to the grip of my leadslinger.<br/><br/>\nThen a confirmation of the horrible truth I had already accepted, as Jaren&#39;s Ghost came to a halt a few paces in front of me.<br/><br/>\nI exhaled and slumped forward.

I&#39;ve finished going over that Ghost&#39;s report. <br/><br/>\nIt is my hypothesis - a hypothesis at best - that the Vex saw the abominable presence at the heart of the Garden as a divine power. I can hear your protest already: how can machines have a god?<br/><br/>\nThe answer is simple. The Vex, for all their voracious intelligence, could not understand or decipher what they found. They searched through all available reactions, and they settled on the course with the greatest payoff...to worship this power, and to remake themselves in its image.<br/><br/>\nI believe the three Axis Minds found in proximity to the abomination were Vex machines built to serve as vessels for this power: a way to extend its reach across space and time, binding it to the Vex, and the Vex to it. If they had succeeded, I cannot begin to guess what horrors they would have unleashed.<br/><br/>\nAttend carefully. There is cause for hope. When endangered, the abomination activated these vessels and defended itself. This tells us that it was threatened. Whatever it was, Guardians could harm it.<br/><br/>\nAnd it activated only a single vessel at a time. Its strength was limited. Whatever it intended, it was not ready yet.<br/><br/>\nWe must assume the abomination was part of something greater. And we cannot flinch from the terrible, obvious comparison: just as the Traveler acts through us, this power was able to act through its own servants.<br/><br/>\nLet us be wary. There may be other abominations, and other vessels.<br/><br/>\nIkora","unlockHowToText":"Unlock this card by playing Destiny.","rarity":3,"unlockFlagHash":0,"points":15,"normalResolution":{"image":{"rect":{"x":646,"y":0,"height":419,"width":323},"sheetPath":"/common/destiny_content/grimoire/images/VexAxisMinds-csprites_37b57d09d748d7015065e0b462de0016.jpg","sheetSize":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":838,"width":1292}},"smallImage":{"rect":{"x":166,"y":0,"height":83,"width":83},"sheetPath":"/common/destiny_content/grimoire/images/VexAxisMinds-csprites-sm_1d6ddab544f2d768b8c413c33c604204.jpg","sheetSize":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":83,"width":664}}},"highResolution":{"image":{"rect":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":728,"width":560},"sheetPath":"/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/504150_a5dae487985a62ae8a1b2f180abcbba9.jpg","sheetSize":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":728,"width":560}},"smallImage":{"rect":{"x":290,"y":0,"height":145,"width":145},"sheetPath":"/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/VexAxisMinds-csprites-sm_b7df3c0b48dd3311da9f3cd58ffb4782.jpg","sheetSize":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":145,"width":1160}}},"statisticCollection":[{"statNumber":1,"cardId":504150,"statName":"Kills","accumulatorHash":0},{"statNumber":2,"cardId":504150,"statName":"Deaths","accumulatorHash":0}]},"509010":{"cardId":509010,"cardName":"Quests Introduction","cardIntro":"<b>&quot;Deny no ally their quests, and together we will explore those paths untraveled.&quot;</b>","cardIntroAttribution":"<i>- The Speaker</i>","cardDescription":"The forces of the City  have spent years sifting through the plights of its Guardians, seeking humanity&#39;s  greatest feats and the true desires of our enemies, but there is still so much unexplored and unknown.<br/><br/>\nThe incessant curiosity of the Tower patrons continues to offer new paths and insights to aid in our survival.
